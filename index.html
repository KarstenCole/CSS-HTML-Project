            <p> <big>Hello.</big> Welcome to my website where my goal is to teach guitar and music theory.
            Hopefully after going through my whole website you can learn a lot about the guitar and music in general.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each page represents a different topic that I will explain in depth. 
            Because of the structure of the website you can leave and come back to where you left off at any time.
            Not only this, but if you perfer to learn only music theory, or only guitar you can do so by clicking on that page.
            You can learn from each page by itself, and they're all different lessons.
            The best way to learn would be by clicking on the link at the bottom of each page to move on, but if you perfer to learn differently I won't get mad.
            </p>

                <img class="wide-photo" src="images/PhotoGallery-4.jpg">
                <img class="wide-photo" src="images/PhotoGallery-2.jpg">

            </div><br>
            <p>
            The best way to learn would be if you had a guitar at home.
            However, if you don't that isn't a problem you could just learn about music theory instead (which is the base for the guitar lessons).
            </p>
            <p>
            All the lessons will have images, and descriptions in order to help demonstrate the techniques and ideas.
            If you feel that you enjoyed the lesson, and want to learn more on your own I have youtube links in the footer to channels who can help you learn more.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope this lesson inspires you to learn more about music or guitar on your own.
