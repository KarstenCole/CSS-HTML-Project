            <h1>Scales</h1>
            <p> 
                Scales are another essential part of guitar playing and music in general.
                Scales are all of the notes in a specific key.
                For example a major scale would be the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of that key.
                All scales start from the root so if you know the key of a certain song you can solo over it with a scale pretty easily.
                All notes in a certain scale will sound good if played in a song of that same key.
                This means that every note sounds good in a Fm scale if its played with a song in Fm.
                This is the most basic concept of improvising.
            </p>

                    At this point however, you won't be improvising yet.
                    You will have to practice the scales up and down.
                    Here is the most basic, and important scale in guitar playing, the pentatonic scale.
                    In this diagram the numbers are what finger you use (1=index, 2=middle, 3=ring, 4=pinky).
                    The root note if the key is minor is the first note, and if the key is major the root is the second note.
                    The great thing about pentatonic is that it works with almost any song.
                    It only has 5 notes instead of 7 so it is able to keep its notes within a lot of different keys.
                    Not only that, but the pattern of a pentatonic scale is very basic, making it easy to memorize and play.
                    If you learn only one thing from this page it should be the pentatonic scale.

                The best way to practice the pentatonic scale, besides going up and down the scale, would be to put it to a backing track.
                If you look up a backing track in any minor scale and then play the pentatonic scale with the root being the first note, it will sound good.

                    Another important guitar scale is the blues scale.
                    This scale is very similar to the pentatonic scale.
                    In fact it is the same except for the extra note.
                    This is known as the blue note, and it makes the pentatonic scale much more jazzy.
                    This can sound good in a lot of different types of songs, not necessarily just blues.
                    The extra note is meant to be used as a transition note in between two notes, and not really meant to be held for a long time.
                    When practicing the pentatonic scale try to incorporate the blue note in order to get more comfortable with the scale.

                The backing tracks for the blues are much better than the minor backing tracks.
                This is because you can use any version of the twelve bar blues to play in the background.
                This allows for a lot of creative freedom, and an easy backing track to play along too.

                These are just the most popular scales guitarists play, but if your interested in learning more I suggest checking out the modes, harmonic minor, or a basic major scale.
